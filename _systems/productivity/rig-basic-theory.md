# RIG (Routines, Ideas, Goals): The Basic Theory
---

## A Smarter Way to Stay Organized and Focused

In a world filled with endless to-do lists, distractions, and competing priorities, staying productive can feel like an uphill battle. Many systems focus on rigid task management, while others prioritize flexibility but lack structure. That’s why I created RIG – a productivity system that balances structure and creativity to help you get things done without feeling overwhelmed.

## What is RIG?

RIG stands for Routines, Ideas, and Goals, three core components that work together to create an effective, sustainable workflow. Whether you’re an entrepreneur, a busy professional, or just someone trying to be more intentional with your time, RIG helps you stay organized while allowing room for creativity and spontaneity.

## Routines: Building a Strong Foundation

Routines are the backbone of productivity. They create stability, reduce decision fatigue, and ensure essential tasks get done consistently. In the RIG system, routines are recurring blocks of tasks that happen on a daily, weekly, or periodic basis.

A good starting set of routines includes:

- Morning Routine – Start your day with purpose (e.g., exercise, planning, journaling).
- Evening Routine – Wind down and prepare for the next day.
- Night Routine – Final wrap-up, relaxation, or reflection.
- Checkpoints – Quick reviews throughout the day to stay on track.
- Workout Routine – Keeping health a priority.

These routines can be scheduled on a calendar as recurring appointments or simply worked through as checklist items. The goal is to automate as much as possible, so you don’t have to rely on willpower alone to stay productive.

## Ideas: Capturing Inspiration Without Pressure

We all have great ideas—but without a system to capture and organize them, they often get lost. The Ideas section of RIG is where you store and develop thoughts, projects, or tasks without committing to them immediately.

- Every idea belongs to one or more projects or broad categories.
- There’s no obligation to act on an idea right away.
- When ready, ideas can be moved into the Goals section for execution.

This approach reduces mental clutter and ensures that creativity is nurtured without pressure. You can revisit ideas when you’re ready and pull the best ones into your active goals.

## Goals: Turning Plans into Action

While Routines keep you grounded and Ideas allow for creative freedom, Goals provide direction and momentum. In the RIG system, Goals are grouped into Monthly, Weekly, and Daily buckets to maintain a structured but adaptable approach.

- Monthly Goals – Big-picture objectives that shape your focus for the month.
- Weekly Goals – Key priorities that break down monthly goals into manageable steps.
- Daily Goals – Actionable tasks that keep progress moving forward.

Goals can be pulled in from Ideas or, if they’re no longer a priority, moved back into the Ideas section to revisit later. This fluid approach ensures you stay focused on what truly matters, rather than just what feels urgent.

## Why RIG Works

The beauty of RIG is its balance between structure and flexibility. Unlike rigid to-do list methods, it:

- ✅ Creates consistency through routines.
- ✅ Encourages creativity by keeping ideas free from pressure.
- ✅ Keeps you action-oriented by setting clear, manageable goals.
- ✅ Reduces overwhelm by allowing goals and ideas to shift naturally.

By integrating habits, inspiration, and execution, RIG provides a holistic approach to productivity that adapts to your personal workflow.
