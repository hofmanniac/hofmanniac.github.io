# **RMP: A Simple, Flexible System for Productivity and Life Management**

## **What is RMP?**

Welcome to **RMP (Routines, Moods, Projects)** – a productivity system designed to help you get things done without rigid schedules or overwhelming to-do lists. Unlike traditional productivity methods that force you into strict timelines, RMP allows you to **work with your energy and mental state** while keeping your life structured and intentional.

RMP is all about **momentum** – it keeps you moving forward in a way that feels natural and sustainable. You’re not just organizing tasks; you’re creating a system that supports both **efficiency and satisfaction** in your daily life.

---

## **Why Use RMP?**

Most productivity systems fail because they don’t account for **how we actually feel** throughout the day. Some tasks require deep focus, while others are best tackled when you need a break. RMP solves this problem by organizing your life into three simple categories:

### **1️⃣ Routines – Your Core Life Structure**
These are your daily and recurring habits that keep your life running smoothly. Instead of treating every task as an individual to-do, RMP groups the essentials into **predictable routines** that reduce decision fatigue.

✅ **Morning Routine** – Start the day with intention (exercise, planning, mindfulness, etc.)  
✅ **Checkpoints** – Flexible pause/review moments (meals, breaks, check-ins)  
✅ **Evening/Night Routines** – Wind down & prepare for tomorrow  

📌 *Why it works:* You don’t have to rethink these tasks every day—they become automatic, freeing up mental space for bigger goals.

---

### **2️⃣ Moods – Work With Your Energy**
Instead of a long, inflexible to-do list, RMP groups tasks based on how you feel at any given moment.

🛑 **Stressors** – Identify the time sensitive or other important and urgent tasks.  
⚡ **Engaged** – Deep work, problem-solving, and goals that require focus and creativity. Items in this category can be tagged with:
   - 🔥 **Fun** – Passion projects and hobbies (e.g., “🎸 Work on music album”).  
   - 🏠 **Improvements** – Home improvements or other deep, long term organization tasks (e.g., “🔧 Organize closet”).  
  
🌿 **Relax** – Low-effort, restorative tasks that recharge your energy.  

📌 *Why it works:* Instead of forcing yourself into productivity, you **choose tasks that match your current mental state**, leading to more efficiency and less burnout.

---

### **3️⃣ Projects – Break Down Big Goals**
Long-term goals and complex tasks don’t belong in your daily to-do list. Instead, they live in **Projects**, which break them down into actionable steps.

📂 Each Project contains:
- **A high-level goal** (e.g., "Build an RPG game")
- **Actionable tasks** (e.g., "Design character sprites," "Write storyline")
- **Projects assigned to a Mood for execution** (e.g., "Game development" goes under *Engaged - 🔥 Fun*)

📌 *Why it works:* You avoid overwhelming yourself with massive goals—Projects keep them manageable and actionable.

## **How to Implement RMP**

The best part? **RMP is flexible and tool-agnostic.** You can implement it using a simple notebook, a digital task manager, or a combination of both.

🔹 **Using RMP in Outlook:** Set up Categories for Routines, Moods, and Projects. Drag tasks into your calendar when needed, or simply pick them from the list as you go.  
🔹 **Using RMP in Notion:** Create a board with columns for Routines, Moods, and Projects. Move tasks between categories based on your focus.  
🔹 **Using RMP on Paper:** Keep a weekly list with Routines at the top, followed by Moods and Project priorities.

## **The Weekly Review: Keeping RMP on Track**

RMP is designed to be **self-maintaining**, but a quick **weekly review** keeps everything fresh:

✅ **Review Routines** – Are habits sticking? Do they need adjustments?  
✅ **Refresh Moods** – Resolve completed stressors, reprioritize tasks.  
✅ **Assess Projects** – What deserves focus this week? Prioritize tasks within projects.

📌 *Why it works:* A 10-minute check-in keeps the system running smoothly and prevents overwhelm.

---

## **Conclusion: Why RMP Works**

RMP is designed for **simplicity, flexibility, and momentum.**

- 🏗 **No more rigid schedules** – Work when you're ready, not just when the clock says so.  
- ⚡ **No more overwhelming lists** – Choose tasks that match your energy.  
- 🎯 **No more lost goals** – Projects keep you focused on long-term success.
