## For People Who Have Too Many Interests (And That's Actually Fine)

*(A practical system for managing creative chaos)*

*Inspired by Tyler Andrew Cole's video ["Too Many Interests: Your New System to Master Multiple Skills"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v1D4BXxdLDI&t=2547s){:target="_blank"} - I adapted and simplified into this rotation system.*

If you're someone with a dozen half-learned skills, twenty open browser tabs about different hobbies, and a constant urge to start something new before finishing the last thing - this is for you.

The problem isn't that you have too many interests. The problem is trying to pursue all of them at once, or feeling guilty for wanting to switch gears, or decision paralysis about what to work on today.

**Microseasons** is a simple rotation system that lets you focus on one main thing while keeping your other interests alive - without the guilt, without the burnout, and without pretending you're ever going to become a person who only does one thing forever.

## 🌱 The Core Idea

Here's how it works:

**Every 1-2 weeks is a "microseason."**

During each microseason, you commit to:

1. **One Main Interest** - This is your sprint. You're actively working toward a tangible outcome.
2. **Two Minor Interests** - These are in maintenance mode. Engage with them as much or as little as you want. Zero pressure.

At the end of the microseason, you decide: keep going, or switch it up?

That's it. That's the whole system.

## 🎯 How to Set Up Your Microseason

**Step 1: Pick Your Main Interest**

Choose one thing you actually want to make progress on right now. Not the thing you think you *should* work on. Not the thing that sounds impressive. The thing that feels alive.

This could be:
- Learning a new skill (drawing, coding, cooking, whatever)
- Working on a creative project (writing, music, game design)
- Building something tangible (an app, a piece of furniture, a garden)
- Exploring a topic deeply (reading, research, experimentation)

**Step 2: Define a Tangible Outcome**

What counts as "done" for this microseason?

Keep it small enough to actually achieve in 1-2 weeks. This isn't about perfection - it's about momentum.

Examples:
- Finish three chapters of that book
- Build a working prototype
- Complete one tutorial series
- Cook five new recipes
- Draw every day for two weeks

The outcome should be specific enough that you'll know when you've hit it.

**Step 3: Pick Two Minor Interests for Maintenance Mode**

These are things you don't want to abandon completely, but you're not actively pushing forward on right now.

Maintenance mode means:
- You can engage with them whenever you feel like it
- You can ignore them if you're busy
- There's no expectation of progress
- They're just there if you want them

Think of these as your "palette cleansers" between focused work sessions, or things you do when your brain needs a break from the main thing.

## 🔄 Living Inside a Microseason

Once you've set up your microseason, here's how to actually use it:

**Your main interest gets priority.**

When you have energy and time to work on something, this is where it goes. You're not juggling everything at once. You're focused. You're making progress. You're allowed to care about this thing.

**Your minor interests are guilt-free.**

Spent an hour messing around with one of them instead of working on your main thing? Great. That's what they're for.

Didn't touch them at all this week? Also great. They're in maintenance mode. They'll be there when you're ready.

**You're not locked in forever.**

If your main interest stops feeling good halfway through the microseason, you can switch. This isn't a prison sentence. It's a framework to help you focus, not a rigid productivity system to optimize your soul out of your body.

## ✨ What This System Actually Does

**Cuts down on decision fatigue.**

You're not waking up every day wondering what to work on. You already decided. For the next two weeks, this is the thing. Your brain gets to relax.

**Lets you enjoy what you're doing.**

When you're only focused on one main thing, you can actually go deep. You stop skimming the surface of everything and start making real progress on something that matters.

**Keeps your other interests alive without the guilt.**

You're not abandoning anything. You're just putting it in maintenance mode. It'll still be there when you rotate back to it.

**Gives you permission to switch.**

Multi-potentialites don't need to "fix" themselves. You don't need to force yourself to stick with one thing forever. This system lets you rotate through your interests intentionally, instead of chaotically bouncing between them.

## 🔁 At the End of the Microseason

After 1-2 weeks, check in:

**How's the main interest feeling?**
- Still excited? Keep going for another microseason.
- Ready for a change? Pick something new.
- Feeling stuck? Maybe it moves to maintenance mode and something else takes the lead.

**What about the minor interests?**
- One of them calling to you? Promote it to main interest next season.
- Still good in the background? Keep them there.
- Lost interest completely? Drop it. You're allowed.

Then set up your next microseason and keep going.

## 💡 Why This Works

It works because it's designed for how your brain actually operates, not for how productivity books say you *should* operate.

You get to:
- Focus without forcing yourself to be monogamous with one interest forever
- Explore without feeling scattered
- Switch without feeling like a failure
- Maintain multiple interests without burning out

And most importantly: **you get to stop feeling guilty about who you are.**

You're not broken for having multiple interests. You're not unfocused. You're not lacking discipline.

You're just someone who needs a rotation system instead of a single-track life.

Microseasons gives you that.
