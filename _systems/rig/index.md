# RIG (Routines, Ideas, Goals): A ~~Productivity~~ Life Management System
---

## Teaser

If your to-do list looks like a chaotic mess of ‚Äúmaybe someday‚Äù tasks mixed with urgent fires to put out, you need a system that actually makes sense. Enter **RIG**‚Äîthe productivity system that balances structure and flexibility so you can stay on top of life *without losing your mind*. It‚Äôs built on **Routines, Ideas, and Goals**‚Äîthe trifecta of getting stuff done. Routines keep you consistent, Ideas let you dream without pressure, and Goals make sure you actually follow through. Think of it as a workout plan for your brain: habits keep you fit, creativity keeps things interesting, and goals make sure you don‚Äôt just binge-watch productivity videos instead of, you know, being productive.  

The best part? RIG works *with* you, not against you. I use **Outlook** to organize everything‚Äîcategorizing tasks, viewing them in the task pane, and dragging them into my calendar when needed. But you can set it up in whatever tool (or notebook) you like. The goal is to stop drowning in unfinished tasks and start making real progress, one step at a time. If this sounds like something you need, stick around - I'll be posting more about how this works, to help you master RIG like a pro. Until then, go set up some Routines, capture some Ideas, and knock out some Goals. Future You will thank you!

## My Story

I‚Äôm a productivity nerd ü§ì. My first planner in college felt like a fresh start each week ‚Äî blank pages, endless possibilities. But my system? Barely a system at all. After a few weeks, I‚Äôd ditch the planner and rely on my brain. Maybe life was simpler. Maybe I just missed things and shrugged them off.

Fast forward ten years, and I hit my tertiary crisis ‚Äî 30 years old! Why wasn‚Äôt I a millionaire yet? Was I doing what I was supposed to? In a moment of self-discovery, I dove into productivity - GTD, blogs, experiments. Some things worked; many didn‚Äôt. Time-blocking clicked‚Äîwhy keep a to-do list when I could just schedule when to do things?

Then life got more complicated - more job responsibilities, kids, personal goals, financial and social pressures. I adapted, tried new systems - Bullet Journaling, Eisenhower Matrix, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt Do‚Äù Lists. Every new trick felt like the answer‚Äîuntil it wasn‚Äôt. I became overwhelmed, robotic, drowning in tasks. Where was the time for me?

So I paused. Tweaked things. Dug into psychology, read Atomic Habits, listened to Cal Newport. I felt torn‚Äîanxious yet always thinking I could be doing more.

Then, while listening to a podcast on Maslow‚Äôs Hierarchy of Needs, it hit me. I wasn‚Äôt searching for a productivity system. I was searching for a *life satisfaction system*. Something to give me objective permission to let go of the "have to do" so I could focus on the "want to do."

And that‚Äôs how the Routines, Ideas, Goals (RIG) system was born ‚Äî a flexible, practical approach to managing life. It helps tame the never-ending chore list, creating space for your aspirations.

Grounded in psychology and real-world tactics, RIG starts with the essentials - your physiological needs - then builds into logistics, relationships, personal growth, and finally, your biggest goals. Because at the end of the day, we all deserve to live up to our greatest potential.

If any of this sounds intriguing to you, then read on! We'll start first with the basic theory, and then move on to how to set this up for yourself. Along the way I'll throw in some tips and tricks including how to "make it your own". The framework is very adaptable, meant to be tweaked and made into your own.
