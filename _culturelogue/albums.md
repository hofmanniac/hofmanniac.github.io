[Vital Signs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_Signs_(Survivor_album)){:target="_blank"} (Survivor, 1984)

[Commodores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodores_(album)){:target="_blank"} (Commodores, 1977) - This was one of my first "albums of the week" and I listened to it probably 20 times. Why? It's so GOOD!
