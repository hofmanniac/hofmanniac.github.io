## Oh Great Another Blog

So I've decided to start blogging. Why? I miss the Internet of the 1990's. I even miss the starry backgrounds and blinking web page counters. And I need these kids to get off my digital lawn with their Tocky Ticks and Skibbidy Whoozits. 

For more information about this and many other exciting topics, head to your local library. Thank you for listening to my TED Talk.
