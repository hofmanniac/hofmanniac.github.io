# This Is Fine: Space Edition

So I've been working on this board game idea that perfectly captures the experience of... well, trying to hold anything together in 2026, really.

It's called **This Is Fine: Space Edition**, and it's exactly what it sounds like: a game about building and managing a spaceship that's perpetually one bad decision away from catastrophic failure.

## The Concept

Picture this: You're adding rooms to your ship like you're playing space Tetris. You're moving around a shared galaxy map. Events keep happening - fires, malfunctions, weird discoveries that may or may not explode. Everything is stacking up in different rooms, and you have *just enough* actions each turn to fix *most* of the problems.

Most.

The game asks the eternal question: "Do I deal with this now, or can I ignore it for one more turn?"

(Spoiler: It spreads.)

## The Vibe

The whole thing leans into stick-figure art and "this is fine" energy. It's strategic chaos with a sense of humor. You're building your ridiculous ship, completing missions, exploring the galaxy, and occasionally helping other players—or watching them burn while you steal their cargo. It's flexible that way.

The goal is to score points through missions before your ship becomes a floating disaster. Or I guess technically *more* of a floating disaster than it already is.

## Current Status

Still very much a work-in-progress! I'm playtesting mechanics, refining the event system, and trying to figure out exactly how mean the galaxy should be allowed to be.

If you're into tabletop games, chaotic strategy, or just appreciate the aesthetic of barely-controlled disaster, you might enjoy watching this develop. Check out the [full project page](/projects/this-is-fine-space-edition/) for more details!

*Because if we're all going down, we might as well make it a board game.*
