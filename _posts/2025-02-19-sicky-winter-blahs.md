# Sicky, Winter Blahs

I feel like I'm living in Severance. The landscape outside is bleak❄️. I'm still getting over this flu (?) that started two weeks ago. It's -5 degrees out. My dog has disowned me, and any time I get the courage up enough to peek at the news headlines I immediately regret it.

On a more positive note, I've been ramping up a lot of personal projects lately (this site included). I do plan to get back to working on my main tech projects soon. I also will be resuming working out again as soon as I'm feeling up to it - maybe this weekend if things hold out.

Also seeing my kiddos grow into the people they are becoming keeps me going. Winter is a season. This one has been tough but better days are ahead...
