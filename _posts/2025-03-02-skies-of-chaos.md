We had fun the other night playing ["Dutch"](https://www.reddit.com/r/cardgames/comments/18e638r/anyone_know_how_to_play_dutch_card_game/?rdt=35616){:target="_blank"}, a rapid-pace card game you can play with a standard deck of cards.

This inspired me to create a Steampunk / RPG variation I'm calling [Skies of Chaos](/games/skies-of-chaos). I need to playtest still, at which point I'll have a printable PDF for it. In the meantime, enjoy the overall idea!
