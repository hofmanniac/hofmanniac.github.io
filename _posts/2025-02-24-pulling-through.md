Feeling much much better. Wow that was like the entire month of February not feeling well. Also had some good news come through from other medical tests I've had to go through recently and so feeling a new lease on life at this point.

I have recently discovered and exploring functional medicine. I'm very anti-conspiracy theorist and anti-homeopathic in general and believe in science. So when I discover something that is not mainstream I take it with a grain of salt. But after reading several books, podcasts, and expirmenting on my own these last several months I'm starting to become a firm believer. Most of the principles are common sense - natural (not processed) foods, massively reduce or eliminate your sugar and alcohol intake, eliminate toxins, protect the liver, feed the gut, and a handful of other strategies and tactics. So far I've lost 30 pounds, and while weight loss was not the goal I feel better (other than the recent illness), have more energy, and feel like the future trajectory of my life is changing for the better.

So onward and upward! I'll continue to share what I learn. Currently have started the recent ["The Ageless Revolution"](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-ageless-revolution-michael-aziz-md/1145841770?ean=9780757325144) by Michael Aziz, MD. So far it's very down to earth.

I also picked up ["Freedom"](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/freedom-angela-merkel/1146307269?ean=9781250319906) by Angela Merkel, which is very interesting to hear about her early life so far in 50's and 60's Germany.

Also started reading ["The Creative Act"](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-creative-act-rick-rubin/1141404747?ean=9780593652886) by Rick Rubin. Saw a neighborhood dad read it once at a swim meet a few years ago and finally decided to dive in. I like that it level sets that anyone and everyone is an artist, participting in the act of creating, whether they know it or not.

And finally - I'm almost finished with the original ["Don't Think of an Elephant"](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dont-think-of-an-elephant-george-lakoff/1110948013?ean=2940171140052) by George Lakoff. This has been extremly eye opening as to the moral frames from conservatives that have dominated recent headlines, and the alternative frames tha progressives can offer to counteract this singular way of thinking about the world. Highly recommended. I didn't realize there was a more recent version until writing this! So looks like I've got my next audiobook picked out.

Finding the time to read and for hobbies can definitely be a challenge. It's a little easier for me now with the kiddos pretty much self-sufficient and able to drive themselves, though I do find the [RIG](/routines-ideas-goals/) system helpful to keep track of my ideas and then to start getting them priortized and on the calendar.

Enough for now. Today was better than yesterday. Tomorrow will be even better than today.
