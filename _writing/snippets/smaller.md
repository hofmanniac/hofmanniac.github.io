These are a bunch of smaller snippets I found lurking in my digital collection. Now unleashed on the world.

## Mind Control

She wanted to control all of their minds, and she could do it.  Since she was a little girl, she knew that she could nudge her way in there, slip past their consciousness and make the tiniest suggestions on what to do next. 

She couldn’t hear their thoughts; those were much too large to be seen.  She focused, one strand at a time, weaving a tapestry of sub thoughts and pulling the knot so tight that finally the web had a life of its own and could choke the louder thoughts out of existence.  Then she had total control. 

Sometimes she was sad, it was too easy to do on children.  As the years went by, she only forced adults to her will, and could only work on one at a time.  She would amuse herself by making them trip, but then that became boring.  She would entangle more elaborate schemes into their lives, set them up for hope with another and then make their words turn against them at the last minute.  Even this became routine.  Then she found the other secret. 

## Chapter 1: Culpa 

The cold, dry wind screamed over the large, sand-blown rocks outside of the Culpa Observatory.  The sun was fading underneath the distant giant mountains. 

## Kiri

“Don’t move,” the voice commanded.     

Kiri opened his eyes in total darkness to the smell of blood and vomit.  Whispers of thoughts breezed through his mind as the clear sensation of pain soared inside of him.  Thoughts stirred, echoed deep in his subconscious, rose to the surface. How long had he been unconscious?  Was he bound?  He tried to move his hands with no success.  The heat of the air weighed down on him heavily. 

Then suddenly, the voice again; was it his own?  Kiri rolled his head to one side and then the other.  He could feel the damp trickle of blood crawling from nose to cheek and then the drip onto the cold stone floor. 

The voice spoke out again.  It was calling his name.  Kiri tried lifting his head and a pain shot through his neck. 

Subconscious thoughts ebbed, pain funneled them into words, darkness and alternate flickers of light burned them into phrases and finally, Kiri could speak. 

“Wh-where I…Where am I?” 

The voice rang out again, too loud to be real. “You are now back in this plane, as you planned to be.  You have overcome a great trial.” 

The words sounded familiar.  Kiri had heard them once, long before.  He could not remember where. 

“Do not move,” the voice repeated. 

Kiri made no such attempt.  His breathing was heavier now, more painful.  A cold, damp sensation sponged across his head.  He closed his eyes, from darkness to darkness. 

In closing his eyes, Kiri became more acutely aware of the sounds around him.  Dripping was coming from his left; several footsteps were coming from the direction of his feet. 

“I’m in the Reviving Chamber,” Kiri remembered to himself. 

“That’s right,” the voice spoke out again, this time much softer and more clearly. 

“I have the Storm Pain,” he thought to himself. 

“No, not the Storm Pain,” the voice answered at once. 

“But it’s in my neck, my hands…,” Kiri protested. 

“You have passed from the Storm Pain into the Earth Pain,” the voice assured him. 

Then he passed out again. 



It was several hours before Kiri awoke again.  He felt the strange sensations coming back to him; sponging on his forehead, blood trickling, the searing neck pain, the blindness.  But this time Kiri opened his eyes again and could make out shapes, entire people shapes moving about around him.  Then at last his eyes settled and he was looking into the eyes of an old friend. 

“Dabala,” he murmured. 

Dabala turned to look at him, his eyebrows turning up in relief. 

“Kiri, old friend – you have finally come back to us.” 

Kiri raised himself up on his elbows,
