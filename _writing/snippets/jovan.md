I wrote this, I think back at the turn of the century? Ha - no joke, probably early 2000's. I remember my goal was just to start writing something and see how far I could get. 

## Chapter One

Jovan hadn’t planned on the diseases getting stronger.  He prayed to Shamba, to Rala, every day brought hope but still more suffering.  The great tree city grew colder as the season progressed.  Soon would be the ceremonies of Dying and the Rites of the Fallen.  Every year hundreds of citizens would turn out for the events.  But this year even the elders had fallen to sickness and disease, leaving none to plan in its wake. 

“Come to bed Jovan, its getting late,” a woman’s voice said. 

Jovan said nothing.  His eyes ached; his hands were cracked and blistered.  He washed his hands, removed his day priest cloak and replaced it with the night version.  Sighing, he had ignored her long enough. 

“I can’t sleep tonight, Koria.  A boy has entered into shadow and needs the Raga.” 

“Where will you find Raga this time of night?”  Her voice was angry.  “The sentries are surly inside by now, and you are too old to be wandering out alone.” 

Jovan looked briefly down at the dirt floor.  Had it been twenty years?  It seemed like only yesterday.  The burning.  The barking and biting.  He knew not to venture out alone at night anymore, past the city borders, into the great dark trees where unspeakable beasts hunted.  He looked at the scar on his leg, then to his disfigured hand. 

“Go to sleep, my wife.  The Outer Bark is too much, even for this old man.”  He winked at her. 

“You’ll lose more than your finger this time, even with Shamba’s protection!” she shook a fist at him. 

Jovan paused for a moment and looked up out into the night sky. 

“It is Banar’s boy,” he said quietly. 

Koria opened her mouth to speak, but the words did not come.  He turned to see her staring back at him.  Then she sat slowly on the bed.  She closed her eyes and touched two fingers to her lips. 

“May Rala give you hope.”

Jovan left the hut with no time to spare.  If the boy had entered into shadows, the rest of him would pass quickly.  Raga weed seemed to offer the only hope at this stage.  How he had prayed that Shamba would give him a vision, something to ease the suffering of his people.  Night after night, he would make the sacrifice and wait for a sign. 

He crossed onto the main bridge connecting the inner residences to the main market.  Not two days before, Jovan remembered, Banar’s boy was leaping down this very bridge, shouting and carrying an armful of Gamba fruit back home to his Papa.  Jovan watched him with a smile as he thought of his own childhood.  Every boy and girl made that same journey ten thousand times in their lives.  Now, Jovan know, the boy would be lucky to take another step. 

He arrived at the bridge’s end.  At this time of night, only sentries were allowed past the gates into the markets beyond.  One sentry was waiting.  Jovan did not recognize this one.  He was strong looking, young.  His voice was smooth and almost child like. 

“I can’t let you through, Jovan.  Not tonight.” 

Jovan was not surprised that he knew his name.  Most people in this part of the city knew the priests and elders. 

“It is a matter of life and death, my son.” 

“The patrols have returned and one was injured.  The beasts are particularly hungry tonight.” 

“It seems that death knocks at every corner lately.  You would do more than one soul a favor to let me through tonight.” 

“I would dishonor your soul and never forgive myself for commending it to Rala before the night is through.” 

Jovan stepped back.  Sentries usually weren’t this adamant.  He sensed a tension now in this man’s voice.  He decided to probe. 

“How bad is it?” 

The man looked around.  “They didn’t get far.  The attacks are getting aggressive now, more coordinated.  Sneaky, some have said.  They sure were spooked.  One of the bigger men he, well, let’s just say I don’t think he’ll be working this part of town much longer,” his voice trailed off. 

Jovan had heard enough. It was time to move. 

“My son, this night is getting longer still.  A son of a sentry leader has fallen ill and awaits my services.  I must security the Elder-pah before shadow overtakes him.” 

The guard looked confused. “Elder-pah?”  He paused.  “But that weed is only found in the Outer Bark! No market will carry that now.” 

“Then the Outer Bark is my destination.” 

The guard’s eyes were firm for a moment, and then looked to Jovan’s. 

“Isn’t Elder-pah the priest name for Raga weed?” 

Jovan smiled.  It was pleasant knowing the younger ones were learning.  “You have been studying.” 

The guard looked serious now.  “I have not had the honor of study, but I would not dishonor you by keeping a priest from his services.  You may pass.” 

Jovan wondered at the ease of this.  But his mind soon brought images of the pale boy, and the thought soon passed. 

“Your deed will not be mentioned to elders nor forgotten by priests.”  And with that, he was off, past the gates and into the sleeping marketplace. 

Silently, the guard watched him pass into the night.

Jovan slipped between the buildings in the darkened marketplace.  He could not risk being seen.  The sentries this close to the Outer Bark would not be as forgiving as the fuard he left behind.   

Soon, the final gate outside the city was in sight.  As he suspected, more guards were waiting in watch. 

Suddenly, a strong arm grasped his shoulder, whipping him backward into the buildings’ shadow.  Instinctively, Jovan raised his arms, but the grip was too much.  Before he could mutter a protest, the hand had covered his mouth and dragged him downward. 

“Out after curfew, old man?” the voice was gruff. 

“In the name of Rala, you are….” 

“You do not speak of such names here, frail one.  I have orders to cut you into two for your dishonor to the great Tambur, whose music is mightier than your feeble plant vomiting…” 

“Let him go, Fori,” a deeper more resonant voice commanded. 

Immediately, Jovan felt the pressure release.  He stumbled for a second, then found his feet again. 

Emerging from the darkness was the great form of a man, strong and proud. He had the lines of Elder Gray forming in his hair, and his stare was boring into Jovan like an animal about to pounce. 

“Banar!” Jovan exclaimed. 

“Jovan?” his gaze eased.  “Jovan! What brings you sneaking in the marketplace this time of night? And where are your robes?”  He paused and cleared his throat, coming closer and pushing Fori out of the way.  His voice grew quieter. 

“And what news of the little one?  Please tell me he returned home tonight.  Did you talk to Elyi? Is she taking care of him?” his words were hurried. 

Jovan glanced at the young guard, who was still staring cold and hard. 

“We had better discuss family matters as a family, old friend.” 

The young guard spat.  “Yes, best to not speak your Shamba heresy here, old man.” 

Banar glowered, “Leave us, Fori.  And you will report home immediately.” 

The young guard smirked and set off. 

Banar watched him leave.  “That one has had a bad night, Jovan.  Pray for him.  He had lost respect and losing more each hour the moons rise higher.” 

“I have no time to lose, Banar.  Your boy has fallen into shadow and requires deep medicine, beyond what I can get in this Rala forsaken marketplace.” 

Banar’s eyes grew wide.  Jovan hated to see this man crumble so easily.  Banar was a leader among men, fearless and proud.  He had known him since childhood and this was his worst hour.   

Jovan continued, “He requires Elder-pah, the Raga weed.  Without it, there is little hope for him, Banar.” 

“But Raga is only found in the Outer Bark!  There is no hope out there!  That young man has the fresh scars to prove it.  The beasts have lost their minds Jovan.” 

“I’m not asking you to go, but give me pass and it will be done.” 

“I’m not asking you to go, friend.  This is my family, this is my task.” 

“You have secrets yet to learn, and the night is my shield.
