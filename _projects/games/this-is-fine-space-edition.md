## 🚀 This Is Fine: Space Edition

*A chaotic spaceship-building board game about barely holding it together*

**This Is Fine: Space Edition** is a light-to-medium strategy tabletop game where players build and manage their own increasingly ridiculous spaceships while trying to survive a galaxy that is… not helping.

Each player starts with a tiny ship made of square room tiles. Over the course of the game, you’ll **expand your ship**, **move around a shared galaxy map**, **deal with disasters**, and **chase missions** - all while things are actively catching fire, breaking down, or causing problems in the wrong room at the worst time.

The goal?
Complete missions, score points, and avoid having your ship turn into a floating punchline.

## 🧩 Build Your Ship (Literally)

Your ship is a **grid of square tiles** representing rooms like Cockpits, Engines, Cargo Holds, Med Bays, and more. You can:

* Add new rooms to grow your ship
* Upgrade rooms to make them better (or at least less terrible)
* Arrange your layout however you like… consequences included

The shape of your ship matters. Where problems land matters. And yes - sometimes the fire is *very* far from the people who can fix it.

## 🌌 Explore the Galaxy

In the center of the table is a **shared hex-grid galaxy map**. On your turn, you can move your ship around to:

* Discover valuable debris
* Run into pirates (or *be* the pirates)
* Complete objectives in specific sectors
* Bump into other players, intentionally or otherwise

The galaxy is interactive, unpredictable, and occasionally rude.

## 🔥 Events, Chaos, and “Oh No”

Events are the heart of the game’s chaos.

When you draw an Event card, it usually gets **assigned to a specific room on your ship**, creating an ongoing problem or effect. Fires, malfunctions, strange discoveries, helpful surprises - it all stacks up in room-specific decks.

You’ll need to decide:

* Do I deal with this now?
* Can I ignore it for one more turn?
* What if it spreads?

(What if it spreads.)

---

## 🧠 Crew, Actions, and Choices

Each turn gives you limited actions, so you’re constantly choosing between:

* Fixing problems
* Using room abilities
* Expanding or upgrading your ship
* Moving in the galaxy
* Interacting with other players

You can play cooperatively, competitively, or somewhere in the morally flexible middle. Helping another player might save the galaxy… or just keep them alive long enough to steal from later.

## 🏁 Winning the Game

Players earn points primarily by completing **Mission cards**, which represent long-term goals and risky objectives. Some reward clever ship layouts. Some reward exploration. Some reward questionable behavior.

The game ends when a set number of missions are completed or the galaxy decides it’s done with you all.

Highest score wins.
Everyone else explodes *spiritually*.

---

## 🎨 Tone & Style

The game leans hard into:

* Hand-drawn, stick-figure art
* Visual gags and “this is fine” energy
* Simple rules with emergent chaos
* A sense that things are never fully under control

It’s funny, strategic, slightly mean, and very aware of how absurd spaceship management would actually be.
