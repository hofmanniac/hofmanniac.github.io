# RIG (Routines, Ideas, Goals): A ~~Productivity~~ Life Management System
---

If your to-do list looks like a chaotic mess of “maybe someday” tasks mixed with urgent fires to put out, you need a system that actually makes sense. Enter **RIG**—the productivity system that balances structure and flexibility so you can stay on top of life *without losing your mind*. It’s built on **Routines, Ideas, and Goals**—the trifecta of getting stuff done. Routines keep you consistent, Ideas let you dream without pressure, and Goals make sure you actually follow through. Think of it as a workout plan for your brain: habits keep you fit, creativity keeps things interesting, and goals make sure you don’t just binge-watch productivity videos instead of, you know, being productive.  

The best part? RIG works *with* you, not against you. I use **Outlook** to organize everything—categorizing tasks, viewing them in the task pane, and dragging them into my calendar when needed. But you can set it up in whatever tool (or notebook) you like. The goal is to stop drowning in unfinished tasks and start making real progress, one step at a time. If this sounds like something you need, stick around - I'll be posting more about how this works, to help you master RIG like a pro. Until then, go set up some Routines, capture some Ideas, and knock out some Goals. Future You will thank you!
