## Hello, World

If you've stumbled upon this page then it's too late - I was not able to warn you. This is my personal site, with random musings, projects, thoughts. Some personal, some professional, and some...well, you decide. A large motivator for me was to start creating more and consuming less. Another was to rally against the corporate social media giants with a place I could post away from the algorithms. And another was to simply hone my skills at writing, creating, and sharing.

## What You're In For

You'll see some short essays, inspired by a recent YouTuber. You'll see lists of books, movies, TV shows, and podcast episodes that I've watched or listened to, or want to watch or listen to. You'll find random samples of music I've written (mostly cringe-worthy, some over 30 years old). You'll see development projects, most of which are experimental and for fun. You'll see loads of other randomness like cartoons, sketches, and half-baked notions.

## A Mind in Progress

Some of my thoughts are political, some religious and personal. My goal with those are mainly to help myself think through the enormously complex and divided world we know find ourselves in, and are never meant to offend, patronize, or pontificate. I need somehwere where I can articulate my thoughts and create a "ground truth" for myself. Realizing that those sort of essays are snapshots in time of a mind-in-progress, and that those thoughts will evolve over time, I ask the reader to indulge an open mind when reading them. In other words, please don't be offended.

## How To Enjoy

But this site is not about politics, or religion, or any other specialized topic. It's simply a place for me to shout out to the world who I am, what I'm up to, and to leave a tiny speck of a dent in history. My main audience is future me, but I hope you may find some of the ideas and content useful in your own travels.

So look around! Explore, share, reuse. Or close your browser now and don't say I didn't warn you...
